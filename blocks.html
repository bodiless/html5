<p>Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline. </p>
<h2> Block-level Elements </h2>
<p>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). </p>
<pre>
  Examples of block-level elements:
    <div>
    <h1> - <h6>
    <p>
    <form>
</pre>
<hr \>
<h2> Inline Elements </h2>
<p>An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. </p>
<pre>
  Examples of inline elements:
    <span>
    <a>
    <img>
</pre>
